# Learning-Go
A series of small code snipppets &amp; exercises to learn Go.

WARNING: During this excercise you will be learning along with me, I am not your teacher, but your peer. I don't know anything about writing robust/correct Go, I'm learning just as you are learning. Do not think that these examples are correct.

Try to complete each task without looking at the solution!
